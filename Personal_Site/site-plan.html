      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Employers don't give a lot of effort when looking into a resume, 
         or even give you much time to show all your accomplishments and 
         projects. If only there was a place to put all of that information 
         in one place. Well, there is! Have you ever thought about a personal 
         portfolio website? I have years of experience in programming and 
         web development and will be able to design a website fitted to you, 
         pleasing to employers, where you can store projects, career overflows, 
         contact information, and even a little bit about yourself. You will 
         want to be a step above your competition and it is such an easy decision.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience would be potential employers I am hoping will hire
        me to work for their company. These people are going to need a simple
        and an easy way to look at all my accomplishments and skills. The employers
        are going to be in either the business or tech field with experience in both. 
        I will need to try and appeal to what they are looking for in an employee so, 
        this website needs to be very professional.

        About Me
        Through highschool I was never too sure about what I wanted to do when 
        I started looking into career paths. I was pushed toward a trade school 
        by my loved ones and decided that was a great idea. While looking at 
        the offered fields I found programming would be a good fit for me, as I 
        like learning new things and solving everyday problems. Through this 
        trade school and personal dedication to my learning, I was able to grow 
        a love for programming. With this I learned how to overcome challenges 
        and persevere through issues I was encountering. This journey has led me 
        to strive for a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. 
        </br></br>
        My name is Jayton Crockett and I am 19 years old. I live in Surprise, 
        Arizona but I am going to school in Idaho at BYUI. I am working towards 
        my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (with a minor in Data Science). 
        I am expected to graduate July, 2024. I am looking for full time jobs or 
        internships in my area of study, something to do with databases, 
        programming, or computer engineering.
