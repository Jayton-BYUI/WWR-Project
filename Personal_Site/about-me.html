                About Me Through highschool I was never too sure about what I
                wanted to do when I started looking into career paths. I was 
                pushed toward a trade school by my loved ones and decided that 
                was a great idea. While looking at the offered fields I found 
                programming would be a good fit for me, as I like learning new 
                things and solving everyday problems. Through this trade school 
                and personal dedication to my learning, I was able to grow a 
                love for programming. With this I learned how to overcome 
                challenges and persevere through issues I was encountering. 
                This journey has led me to strive for a Bachelors Degree in 
                Computer Science.

                My name is Jayton Crockett and I am 19 years old. I live in 
                Surprise, Arizona but I am going to school in Idaho at BYUI. I 
                am working towards my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science (with 
                a minor in Data Science). I am expected to graduate July, 2024. 
                I am looking for full time jobs or internships in my area of study, 
                something to do with databases, programming, or computer 
                engineering.
