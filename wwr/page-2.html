                    and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and 
                    great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from 
                    from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and 
                    boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence

                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This 
                    designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon 
                    tells.

                <h3>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river 
                   trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                   </br></br>
                   Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
                   scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is 
                   filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons 
                   and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                   </br></br>
                   CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids 
                   in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a 
                   wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar 
                   with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
