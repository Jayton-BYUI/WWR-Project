                Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate 
                land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river
                and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and 
                great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from 
                from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and 
                boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence 
                of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater 
                opportunities.</br></br>
                Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</br></br>
                Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This 
                designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon 
                tells.</br></br>

            <h3 id="arizona-header">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
            <p id="arizona-left">
                This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river 
                trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                </br></br>
                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
                scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is 
                filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons 
                and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                </br></br>
                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids 
                in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a 
                wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar 
                with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</br></br>
